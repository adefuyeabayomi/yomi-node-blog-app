Thus it can be seen that most of Aegon’s actual conquering took place from 2–1 BC, Before the Conquest.","published":1666395037003,"lastUpdated":1666395037006,"created":1666384741356,"coverImageFileExtension":".jpg","coverImageFileName":"pexels-baskin-creative-studios-1766838qLp8xB6uZRfjmkeo7rHKzrzUf63W5F","category":"Hot Topics","folder":"October2022","id":"7yOS0mK9EPK0slor4ETr3pwcBhxY1UfT3GqYvnU6"},"HZzvkQQFYugf3XdHbELVwxLLrw3khKOtagPLlHiJ":{"title":"Here Is A Method That Is Helping LAGOS CAR DEALERS","firstParagraph":"Dragonstone had been the westernmost outpost of Valyrian power for two centuries. Its location athwart the Gullet gave its lords a stranglehold on Blackwater Bay and enabled both the Targaryens and their close allies, the Velaryons of Driftmark (a lesser house of Valyrian descent) to fill their coffers off the passing trade. Velaryon ships, along with those of another allied Valyrian house, the Celtigars of Claw Isle, dominated the middle reaches of the narrow sea, whilst the Targaryens ruled the skies with their dragons.","published":1666395354629,"lastUpdated":1666395354631,"created":1666384730175,"coverImageFileExtension":".jpg","coverImageFileName":"pexels-stein-egil-liland-3408744J8FCbtEJklUg8B5gKWkqIg4kvwchsZ","category":"Hot Topics","folder":"October2022","id":"HZzvkQQFYugf3XdHbELVwxLLrw3khKOtagPLlHiJ"},"G5pjV7Z8BYMeXmfpubW5me2cdLO2eQE5fI2Tz9xB":{"title":"At Last, The Secret To LAGOS CAR DEALERS Is Revealed","firstParagraph":"Yet even so, for the best part of a hundred years after the Doom of Valyria (the rightly named Century of Blood), House Targaryen looked east, not west, and took little interest in the affairs of Westeros. Gaemon Targaryen, brother and husband to Daenys the Dreamer, followed Aenar the Exile as Lord of Dragonstone, and became known as Gaemon the Glorious. Gaemon’s son Aegon and his daughter Elaena ruled together after his death. After them the lordship passed to their son Maegon, his brother Aerys, and Aerys’s sons, Aelyx, Baelon, and Daemion. The last of the three brothers was Daemion, whose son Aerion then succeeded to Dragonstone.","published":1666395397553,"lastUpdated":1666395397556,"created":1666384767990,"coverImageFileExtension":".jpg","coverImageFileName":"pexels-jeshootscom-138616cdmWCznV2FkBpzdnPU4AARiPnteAk","category":"Hot Topics","folder":"October2022","id":"G5pjV7Z8BYMeXmfpubW5me2cdLO2eQE5fI2Tz9xB"},"qeZByxQZUuu2rQukXS1xJjC9LcpiDtOi0obEsPAQ":{"title":"Warning: These 9 Mistakes Will Destroy Your LAGOS CAR DEALERS","firstParagraph":"   The Aegon who would be known to history as Aegon the Conqueror and Aegon the Dragon was born on Dragonstone in 27 BC. He was the only son, and second child, of Aerion, Lord of Dragonstone, and Lady Valaena of House Velaryon, herself half Targaryen on her mother’s side. Aegon had two trueborn siblings; an elder sister, Visenya, and a younger sister, Rhaenys. It had long been the custom amongst the dragonlords of Valyria to wed brother to sister, to keep the bloodlines pure, but Aegon took both his sisters to bride. By tradition, he would have been expected to wed only his older sister, Visenya; the inclusion of Rhaenys as a second wife was unusual, though not without precedent. It was said by some that Aegon wed Visenya out of duty and Rhaenys out of desire.","published":1666395533489,"lastUpdated":1666454129601,"created":1666384780126,"coverImageFileExtension":".jpg","coverImageFileName":"l7i2y564rupCUuIRgqXM4ELDcuH8slQlxRVAmqoIl","category":"Hot Topics","folder":"October2022","id":"qeZByxQZUuu2rQukXS1xJjC9LcpiDtOi0obEsPAQ"}}}};
